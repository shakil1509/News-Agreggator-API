# news-api-aggregator
RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow users to register, log in, and set their news preferences. The API will then fetch news articles from multiple sources using external news APIs. The fetched articles should be processed and filtered asynchronously on user preference.

Implements input validation and sanitization for user registration, event creation, and updates.
Implements unit testing, focusing on testing input validation and proper functioning of CRUD operations to achieve good test coverage and test edge cases.
Refactors the API code to improve error handling, ensuring that appropriate error messages are returned for different types of errors (e.g., validation errors, authentication errors, authorization errors, and server errors).
Logging the API requests and responses for auditing purposes. Use a logging library like Winston or Morgan to log request and response data.
